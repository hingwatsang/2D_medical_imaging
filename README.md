# 2D_medical_imaging

<b> Project Overview </b> <br>
In this project, I applied the skills that I acquired in a 2D medical imaging course to analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, I formally described my model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.

The medical images with clinical labels for each image that were extracted from their accompanying radiology reports were provided.

The project included a training of deep learning architecture, as well as access to 112,000 chest x-rays with disease labels acquired from 30,000 patients.

<b> Project Highlight </b> <br>
This project gave me hands-on experience with 2D medical imaging data analysis and preparation of a medical imaging model for regulatory approval.

Upon completion of this project, I would be able to:

<li> recommend appropriate imaging modalities for common clinical applications of 2D medical imaging </li>
<li> perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance </li>
<li> establish the appropriate ‘ground truth’ methodologies for training algorithms to label medical images </li>
<li> extract images from a DICOM dataset </li>
<li> train common CNN architectures to classify 2D medical images </li>
<li> translate outputs of medical imaging models for use by a clinician </li>
<li> plan necessary validations to prepare a medical imaging model for regulatory approval </li>
